Each transaction executed via AutoLoop uses gas, and the total cost corresponds to the gas consumed multiplied by the gas price.","AutoLoop applies a service fee to the contract. This total fee is a percentage of the gas used by the transaction, divided between the controller (the entity executing the function or \"progressing the loop\") and the AutoLoop protocol itself. These proportions are determined by the CONTROLLER_FEE_PORTION and PROTOCOL_FEE_PORTION variables.","For a detailed understanding of the cost, consider this formula:","This formula allows you to estimate the cost of running our service, including both the gas costs and the AutoLoop fees.","Note that the total cost of using AutoLoop, i.e., executing a function or \"progressing the loop,\" will be debited from your balance so always maintain an adequate amount of Ether deposited to cover both the gas costs and fees."]}]]
